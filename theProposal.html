          <p>On Valentine's Day 2017, I surprised Kalli with a trip to DisneyLand. I had bought the Disneyland tickets and booked the hotel room for the week of spring break. During the four weeks prior to the trip, Kalli was overwhelmed with excitement! She was so excited that she ended up pretty much planning everything for the trip. I just had one request. I said the last time I was in California I didn't get to see the sunset over the ocean because it was to cloudy. So Kalli looked for a beach that we could watch the sunset from when we arrived in California. Little did she know, she was planning her own engagement!</p>
          <br/>
          <p>There was a problem though. I needed a ring! I only had about a month until our trip. Luckily, when we were at my moms during a weekend away from school, my sister London asked Kalli to go shopping with her at the mall. I knew I didn't have much time so my mom, step father, and I jumped in the car and ran to Jared's. It was extremely nerve racking considering that Jared's was right across the street from the mall. Halfway through picking a ring, Kalli called my mom and freaked us all out. We just ignored her call haha. They didn't have exactly what I was looking for so I ended up having them make something custom.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>With the ring safely tucked away in my jacket under all of our luggage, we were off. Eleven hours of driving later, we were checked into our hotel and headed to the beach to watch the sunset. In order to bring the ring I told Kalli I was going to bring my jacket just in case it got cold. Once we reached the beach we were surprised at how many people were there; not too many. I thought it was going to be packed and awkward with a bunch of people around us, but as the sun drew near to the horizon, everyone migrated to the other side of the beach and we ended up alone. So when the sun hit the horizon, I had her stand as I got down on one knee. I opened the box, looked her in the eyes and said "will you marry me?" She looked me in the eyes and said... "The box is upside down". I quickly flipped the box over and looked at her again. She then said “Yes!"</p>
          <br/>
          <p>At this point I was expecting some tears or excitement, but she just gave a firm yes haha. Then as time went on, the excitement set in and she started to realize what had just happened.</p>
